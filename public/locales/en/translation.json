The conditions to be fulfilled by the organizations involved in the certification of vehicles are also defined, as well as keeping records of certificates and certificates issued. Remodeling a vehicle is described as a change that: change the technical characteristics of the vehicle, add or remove certain circuits or devices, changing the original state or change the make, type and type of vehicle, change the body-chassis elements essential to secure the suspension elements and system control and transmission of basic circuits, control and braking systems, installs engines of another type, type and characteristics, installs devices for propulsion of vehicles with alternative fuels, etc. The structural and technical characteristics of vehicles and their assemblies and components must comply with the applicable national regulations and standards, and if the relevant national regulations are not adopted for the vehicles and their components and assemblies, then the international regulations or standards of the manufacturer shall apply. Similarly, if there are no manufacturer regulations, standards or norms for vehicles and their components and parts, then the usual rules of technology, or rules laid down by the Ministry of Communications and Transport, shall apply at the proposal of the certification bodies and in accordance with acceptable technical solutions. Certification consists of administrative, technical and testing tasks.
